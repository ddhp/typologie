    body: 'Typologie is a bi-annual publication that takes us on a journey to the heart of everyday objects. Its goal is to broaden common perceptions of familiar things by encouraging its audience to see them anew - through the eyes of industrialists, designers and end users who are passionate about them. Measuring 21cm wide by 26 cm high and composed of 60 pages, Each volume of Typologie is devoted to one object and will explore his secrets by documenting their manufacture, detailing their history, and highlighting their enduring relevance. The beauty of each typology will be celebrated in a series of sixty original prints complemented by archival documents and behind-the-scenes photograph as well as a joint interview and an author text. Typologie will be co-published by Collections Typologie and éditions B42 and published in English and French versions for a price of 20 euros per issue.'

      'The first issue of Typologie explores the petanque boule. In it we examine all sides of this well-known object by discussing petanque’s affiliation with the universal and ancient tradition of boule games and examining the broad range of techniques used to produce the boule itself. We also explore the role of the individual boule within petanque and its personification of the carefree, recreational side of life that the game represents. Our investigation reveals the rich and layered character behind these seemingly homogenous spheres.',
      'The issue includes an essay on these themes by Philippe Louguet - an architect, urban planner, design theorist and painter. This is complemented by an in-depth joint interview between Bruno Tainturier (industrial designer and co-founder of the Gulliver design agency) Romain Souvignet (the president of Obut) and Philippe Quintais (professional petanque player and world champion). The text is supplemented by photographs from the Obut archives as well as behind-the-scenes shots of the company’s modern plant and boule museum - all taken by the Typologie team.'
